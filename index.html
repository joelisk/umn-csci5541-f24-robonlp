<h2 id="introduction">Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</b>
</p>
<p>
Our problem is we wanted to use natural language to allow a robot to perform complex tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</b>
</p>
<p>
Using LLMs to actuate robotic arms are being used, but they are often limited in the complexity of the task.
<p>

<p>
<b>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</b>
</p>
<p>
If we are successful, this could be a simple framework for non-robotics experts to actuate a robotic arm. This could 
also save experts time to focus on more difficult or novel tasks.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>
<b>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</b>
</p>

<p>
Our approach was to create a data structure that could handle objects in an environment with action strings associated with each object (i.e. "open", "close", "move_to").
In this way, complex tasks could be broken down into simple language for the LLM which should decrease the output errors.
As we did more research on the VAE, we realized that the output of the VAE (joint angles) would be incompatable with what the LLM portion of the system was trying to accomplish (task sequencing).
This coupled with the time and resource-intensive data collection for the VAE led us to abandon it.
</p>

<p>
<b>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</b>
</p>

<p>
One problem we encountered was that the LLM doesn't always do the task sequencing completely (in one trial with Gemini, it forgot to add a second slice of bread).
The opposite problem also occurred, where it added a sequence too completely (it used all available objects to a sandwich sequence,
combining peanut butter and jelly with ham, mustard, and pickles). It seems that without very careful prompting, the LLM is susceptible to
both logic errors and not using "common sense" reasoning.

<b>Initial qualitative results of action scheme</b>
</p>
<p>
For a basic assessment of LLMs with the JSON action scheme, we used Claude AI to generate a JSON where it was taked to make a sandwich as a robot arm. 
While the Claude AI came up with a logical action sequence, its final sandwich contained ingredients that aren't commonly used together.

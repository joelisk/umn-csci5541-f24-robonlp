#### Feedback from TA:
- Ignore vision (for now)
- Novelty can be found in creating a grid of different LLMs, different model sizes and coming up with some kind of grade for the 
intermediate steps in task sequencing
- Some of the metrics we can consider are # of intermediate steps until success, upper limit of number of intermediate steps before failure
